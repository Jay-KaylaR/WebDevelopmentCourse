✅ *Top Web Development Frameworks You Should Know* 🌐🧰

Whether you're building frontend UIs or backend APIs, frameworks speed up development and enforce good practices.

*1️⃣ What is a Web Framework?*  
A web framework is a pre-built structure (set of tools & libraries) that simplifies building web apps and services.

*2️⃣ Popular Frontend Frameworks:*  
- *React.js* → Component-based UI library by Meta  
- *Vue.js* → Lightweight & flexible, easy to learn  
- *Angular* → Full-featured framework by Google  
- *Svelte* → Compiles code at build time, no virtual DOM  

*3️⃣ Popular Backend Frameworks:*  
- *Express.js (Node.js)* → Minimal & fast REST API builder  
- *Django (Python)* → Batteries-included, secure & scalable  
- *Flask (Python)* → Lightweight and flexible  
- *Spring Boot (Java)* → Production-ready backend apps  
- *FastAPI (Python)* → Fast, async-ready, great for APIs  
- *Laravel (PHP)* → Elegant MVC framework  

*4️⃣ Full-Stack Frameworks:*  
- *Next.js* (React + backend API routes)  
- *Nuxt.js* (Vue-based full stack)  
- *Meteor.js* (Real-time apps)  
- *Ruby on Rails* (Full-stack MVC for rapid development)

*5️⃣ Why Use Frameworks?*  
✔️ Saves time  
✔️ Enforces structure  
✔️ Built-in security  
✔️ Easier maintenance  
✔️ Community support

*6️⃣ Framework vs Library:*  
- *Library* = You call it (e.g., React)  
- *Framework* = It calls you & controls flow (e.g., Angular)

💡 *Start with one frontend + one backend framework to become full-stack ready!*
